We have written a story about this project and provided a tutorial at [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/technology-center-de-volksbank-nl/aws-iot-buttons-fresh-cloud-coffee-95423f).

## Why do this?

> Modern electronics are great. They do have a disappointing downside however: they tend to break. 
> A lot. Here at de Volksbank, we are currently asking users of coffee machines, printers, etc. to report broken systems in a system or by calling support. 
> While this generally works fine, the worst moment to ask someone to make a phone call is 9 in the morning when they didn't have their coffee yet.
> To make the process even simpler and quicker, we wanted to automate the process even further. 
> Now coffee machines and printers can include a simple dedicated button which takes care of everything. 
> Pushing it activates a function in the cloud which notifies the right people that a machine is defect, 
> without ever needing to interact with a system or calling the help desk. This also helps the support staff who will no longer be flooded by duplicate messages: 
> if a defect has been reported once, the buttons will automatically stop sending messages until the problem has been fixed. A fun little project and a win for everyone!
